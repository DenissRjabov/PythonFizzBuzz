#FizzBuzz is a well-known game that allows you to master the rules of division in a playful way. Participants sit in a circle so that the game could theoretically continue indefinitely. The first player says "one", and passes the turn to the one on the left. Each next player must mentally add to the previous one and say either it or one of the keywords: Fizz if the number is divisible by three without a remainder, or Buzz if by five. If both of these conditions are observed, then he pronounces Fizz-Buzz. The player who fails to say the correct word is out of the game. The last remaining player is declared the winner. The developed program implements the Fizz-Buzz game algorithm in relation to the first 100 numbers. Each subsequent answer is displayed on a new line.
